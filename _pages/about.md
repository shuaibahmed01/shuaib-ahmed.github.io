Hey! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shuaib, I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC Davis studying Computer Science and interested in the applications of machine learning/deep learning to improve and create new systems.


Currently I am working on applied AI with the EBS (Elastic Block Store) team at AWS . Previously, I've worked on age collection and verification at Meta where I built out new age verification pipelines through age prediction and ID verification. I've also spent time at Geico, where I built a novel CRM tool which allows customers to receive assistance from a virtual assistant through LLM integration.


In the past, I've also done privacy security/research at UC Davis under [Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) on evasive bot traffic on the internet. Here I co-authored a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07647) which was accepted at **ACM IMC 25'**.


I am also extremely interested in the startup space, hence my rewarding time at [Deeptrust](https://www.deeptrust.ai/), where I was building call security against voice-phishing and deepfakes. I also contributed to [TerifAI](https://www.terif.ai/), an **open source** educational voice phishing ai agent which can clone a users voice in <10 seconds and simulate a real-world voice-phishng scam.
